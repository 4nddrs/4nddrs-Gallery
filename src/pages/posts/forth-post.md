## 📌 Why customize your terminal?
As developers, we spend hours in the terminal.  
A well-customized terminal is **not just for aesthetics** — it improves **readability, workflow, and focus**.  
Every element, from colors to icons, communicates information at a glance and makes work enjoyable.

## ⚙️ Tools I Use
- **Windows Terminal** → modern, flexible, and supports tabs.  
- **PowerShell** → my main shell for scripts and automation.  
- **Oh My Posh** → adds custom icons, segments, and a unique prompt.  
- **BAT** → enhanced `cat` with **syntax highlighting** for reading files in color.  
- **Custom Fonts & Nerd Icons** → all glyphs and icons in my prompt.

## 🎨 My Custom Setup
- **Prompt:** fully personalized to show Git branch, Node version, errors, and workspace.  
- **Background:** semi-transparent, so I can keep a sense of context without clutter.  
- **Icons:** custom glyphs for folders, Git, errors, and tools, making the terminal **visually informative**.  
- **BAT for files:** gives colors to scripts and configs, improving readability instantly.
